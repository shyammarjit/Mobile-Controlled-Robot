I have successfully completed my project for the course "Introduction to A.I and I.O.T " from IIT-Kanpur. In this project, I have created a Mobile Control Smart Robot and an android application to control that Robot. This project is guided by Dr Sandeep Gupta who is the mentor and the supervisor of this project. This Robot is enhanced with the IoT features, it's capable of detecting obstacles, it can measure the collision distance and provide those data to us. 
In that video, I represented the working principles of this WiFi-Controlled-Robot.
There are five functionalities in this application. Those are 
forward motion,
left turning,
right turning,
device control
and at the last, there is a "get data" button. 
This Robot is enhanced with the IoT features, it's capable of detecting obstacles, it can measure the collision distance and provide those data to us.
